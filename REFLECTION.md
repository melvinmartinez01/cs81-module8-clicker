# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?

What helped me understand was realizing the DOM is basically the page turned into objects that JavaScript can grab and change.
Once I used `document.getElementById()` to target elements like the counter and message area, it clicked for me that I could
update the page instantly using `textContent` inside the click event.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?

I choose to use progress checkpoints and matched the vibe of a "keep going" game. I used certain numbers so that it would be 
easy to test, with the help of `if / else if` logic.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?

The challenge I faced was figuring out what the `const` would be.

## What personal twist did you add?

I added a "Bubba Edition" theme, changed background color at milestones, added a status/badge line, and changed button texts to 
emojis after a certain amount of clicks. 

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?

A real-world app that uses this kind of interaction are social media that allow you to like, up/down vote, achievement/progress 
trackers.
